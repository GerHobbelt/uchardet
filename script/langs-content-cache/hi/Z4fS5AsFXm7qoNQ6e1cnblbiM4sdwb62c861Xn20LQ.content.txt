The Census defines Honolulu CDP as the portion of the City and County that is coextensive with the Judicial District of Honolulu. Honolulu CDP is what is generally thought of as the "city" of Honolulu, and its population is used here and in other population comparisons
^ c: Arlington CDP, Virginia is coextensive with Arlington County. Virginia law forbids the creation of cities in counties with over 1,000 people per square mile, which Arlington County exceeds. Thus, the entire county is considered by the Census Bureau as one CDP.
^ d: St. Louis, Baltimore, and the cities in Virginia, excepting Arlington, are all independent cities that are not a part of any particular county.
^ e: Some cities may challenge the annual Census estimates. Cities from the above list that have filed successful challenges to date are St. Louis, Baltimore, New York City, Detroit, Milwaukee, West Valley City, Utah, and West Jordan, Utah.
