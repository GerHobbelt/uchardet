== Y - Australia ==
Also see airport category and list.
The prefix Y is reserved for Australia. For many (but not all) Australian ICAO codes, the second letter indicates which Flight Information Region (FIR) the airport belongs to — B Brisbane, S Sydney, M Melbourne and P Perth. However, the Sydney and Perth FIRs no longer exist and have been merged into the Brisbane and Melbourne FIRs, although the airport codes remain unchanged (eg. Sydney YSSY, Darwin YPDN).
