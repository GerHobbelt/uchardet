The Golden Ball award is presented to the best player at each FIFA World Cup finals, with a shortlist drawn up by the FIFA technical committee and the winner voted for by representatives of the media. Those who finish as runners-up in the vote receive the Silver Ball and Bronze Ball awards as the second and third most outstanding players in the tournament respectively. The award was introduced in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, sponsored by adidas and France Football.

The Golden Boot or Golden Shoe Award goes to the top goalscorer of the FIFA World Cup. While every World Cup had a ranking of the goalscorers, the first time an award was given was in 1982, under the name Golden Shoe. It was rechristened Golden Boot in 2010. FIFA sometimes lists the top goalscorers of previous Cups among the Golden Boot winners.If there is more than one player with the same amount of goals, since 1994 the tie-breaker goes to the player who has contributed the most assists - with the FIFA Technical Study Group deciding whether an assist is to be counted as such. If there is still more than one player, the tie-breaker since 2006 goes to the player who has played the least amount of time.

4 Salenko is the only player to win the award playing for a team that were eliminated in the group stages. His six goals are the only international goals he ever scored.
5 Despite the assist tiebreaker, Salenko and Stoichkov remained tied with 6 goals and one assist each, and both received the Golden Ball.6 Romário and Andersson surpassed the other two players with five goals (Jürgen Klinsmann and Roberto Baggio) by having three assists each.7 Both runner-ups had the same number of assists, and each received the Silver Ball.
8 During the tournament, after the group stage match against Costa Rica, Ronaldo logged a protest against the crediting of a goal as an own goal, and FIFA granted him the change.9 Eight players had scored three goals. Ronaldo, Crespo and Zinedine Zidane stood out for having one assist, and then the two recipients were determined by less playtime (308 minutes for Crespo, 411 for Ronaldo, 559 for Zidane).10 Müller, Villa, Sneijder and Forlán tied with 5 goals. Müller won by virtue of having more assists (3) than the rest (each had 1). Villa won the Silver Boot due to playing fewer minutes than Sneijder, and Sneijder won the Bronze Boot due to having played fewer minutes than Forlán.11 Neymar, Lionel Messi and Robin Van Persie all had four goals in the tournament. Neymar got the Bronze Boot for playing fewer minutes than his competitors.

The Golden Glove Award is awarded to the best goalkeeper of the tournament. The award was introduced with the name Lev Yashin Award in 1994, in honor of the late Soviet goalkeeper. The FIFA Technical Study Group recognises the top goalkeeper of the tournament based on the player's performance throughout the final competition. Although goalkeepers have this specific award for their position, they are still eligible for the Golden Ball as well, as when Oliver Kahn was awarded in 2002. Although the Golden Glove Award was first awarded in 1994, every All-Star Team in World Cups prior to 1998 but 1990 included only one goalkeeper.

The Yashin Award was first awarded in 1994.

The award was renamed the Golden Glove Award in 2010.
