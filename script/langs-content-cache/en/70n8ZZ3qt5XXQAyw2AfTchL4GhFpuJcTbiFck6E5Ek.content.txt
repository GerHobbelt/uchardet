Wabun code (和文モールス符号, wabun mōrusu fugō, Japanese text in Morse code) is a form of Morse code used to send Japanese language in kana characters. Unlike International Morse Code, which represents letters of the Latin script, in Wabun each symbol represents a Japanese kana. For this reason, Wabun code is also sometimes called Kana code.When Wabun code is intermixed with International Morse code, the prosign DO (  ▄▄▄ ▄ ▄ ▄▄▄ ▄▄▄ ▄▄▄ ) is used to announce the beginning of Wabun, and the prosign SN (  ▄ ▄ ▄ ▄▄▄ ▄ ) is used to announce the return to International Code.
