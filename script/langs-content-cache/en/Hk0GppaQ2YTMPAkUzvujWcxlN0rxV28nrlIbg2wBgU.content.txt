The British Junior Open squash championship is considered the second most prestigious junior open squash championship after the World Junior Squash Championships. It is one of the five Tier 2 events in the WSF World Junior Squash Circuit. British Junior Open is divided into ten categories â€” Boys Under-19, Boys Under-17, Boys Under-15, Boys Under-13, Boys Under-11, Girls Under-19, Girls Under-17, Girls Under-15, Girls Under-13, and Girls Under-11.The Under-19 boys category was known as the Drysdale Cup before 1999; the Under-16 and Under-14 categories were both held prior to 1999, until being replaced by Under-15 and Under-17 categories respectively. The Under-13 categories were also introduced in the same year. The tournament moved to Birmingham from 2018 onwards, where the Under-11 categories were introduced.
