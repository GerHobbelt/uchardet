The last release of Kivio mp was version 3.0, made in December 2004. That release was based on Qt 3.


== Calligra Flow ==
Calligra Flow is free diagramming software that is a part of Calligra Suite, successor of Kivio. It has a user interface that is similar to Microsoft Visio. Created objects can be embedded into other Calligra Suite products.


=== History ===

After announcing the split of the KOffice developer community in 2010-06-11, the Kivio code was imported into the newly formed Calligra project and picked up by a new maintainer who renamed the application to Calligra Flow. When KDE community had announced the start of Calligra Suite in 2010-12-06, a flowchart programme named 'Flow' was part of the announcement.
Flow was shipped with the first Calligra Suite Snapshot Release.A stable release was made along with the rest of Calligra Suite 2.4.
Since Calligra 3.0, Flow was removed from Calligra Suite, then was retired and replaced by Karbon in Calligra 3.2.0.
