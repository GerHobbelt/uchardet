Born is the first album released by the classical crossover string quartet Bond, and was produced by Magnus Fiennes and Gareth Cousins. The album was a worldwide success, reaching the top twenty in charts across Europe. The album reached number 16 in the UK charts, spending six weeks in the top 40, and was also number one in the UK Classical charts, but it was subsequently removed from these charts for not meeting all the 'rules' of classical music.
The album was re-released in 2001 with an additional track.
