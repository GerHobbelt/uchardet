Diadem (1914â€“1931) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse who won the 1000 Guineas in 1917. She went on to become a top sprinter, recording two victories in both the King's Stand Stakes and the July Cup. In total she won 24 of her 39 races. Diadem was bred and owned by Edgar Vincent, 1st Viscount D'Abernon, and trained by George Lambton. The Diadem Stakes at Ascot Racecourse was named after her.


== Background ==
Diadem was a chestnut filly bred by Edgar Vincent, 1st Viscount D'Abernon and foaled in 1914. She was sired by Epsom Derby and Irish Derby winner Orby. As a stallion Orby sired Derby winner Grand Parade and Champion Stakes winner Orpheus. Diadem's dam was Donnetta, a daughter of Donovan.

At the Doncaster St. Leger meeting she carried top weight and started favourite for the seven-furlong Town Moor Handicap. She took the lead with a quarter of a mile still to run and despite being challenged in the closing stages, she held on the win by a head from Quadrille.

== Assessment ==
In 1918 she was described as "one of the most brilliant sprinters seen in England for very many years." She finished her career with 24 wins from 39 starts. In 1946 Ascot Racecourse named a new sprint race in her honour, the Diadem Stakes, which is now known as the British Champions Sprint Stakes.


== Breeding record ==
Diadem was retired to become a broodmare. In 1928 one of her foals, Dian, was sold for 14,000 guineas. At the same auction Diadem herself was purchased by Major Mairs for 10,000 guineas. Diadem died in 1931.


== Pedigree ==
Note: b. = Bay, br. = Brown, ch. = Chestnut
* Diadem was inbred 3x4 to Galopin. This means that the stallion appears once in the third generation and once in the fourth generation of her pedigree.
