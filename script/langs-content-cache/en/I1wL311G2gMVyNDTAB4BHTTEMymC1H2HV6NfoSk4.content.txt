Three-time defending champion Rafael Nadal defeated Novak Djokovic in the final, 6–0, 6–2, 7–5 to win the men's singles tennis title at the 2020 French Open. It was his record-extending 13th French Open title and 20th major title overall, equaling Roger Federer's all-time record of men's singles titles. For the fourth time in his career, Nadal won the title without dropping a set during the tournament; for the first time in French Open history, neither the men's nor women's singles champions lost a set. Nadal also became the first player, male or female, to win 100 matches at the French Open and only the second man, after Federer at the Australian Open and Wimbledon, to win 100 matches at the same major. Djokovic was attempting to become the first man in the Open Era to achieve the double career Grand Slam (a feat he would accomplish at the following year's tournament).Lorenzo Giustino defeated Corentin Moutet 0–6, 7–6(9–7), 7–6(7–3), 2–6, 18–16 in the first round. The match was the second-longest in French Open history, lasting 6 hours and 5 minutes, and the fourth-longest in major history. Taylor Fritz and Lorenzo Sonego played the longest tie-break in French Open history: Sonego won the third set tie-break 19–17 to win their third-round match 7–6(7–5), 6–3, 7–6(19–17).Jannik Sinner became the first man to reach the quarterfinals of the French Open on debut since Nadal in 2005 and the youngest quarterfinalist since Djokovic in 2006. He also became the first man born in the 21st century to reach a major quarterfinal.Rafael Nadal and Jannik Sinner's quarterfinal was the first men's match to start at night in French Open history. Their match, which was played under very cold and windy conditions, started after 10:00 pm CEST and finished at 1:26 am. This was the first ever French Open match to finish after midnight.
