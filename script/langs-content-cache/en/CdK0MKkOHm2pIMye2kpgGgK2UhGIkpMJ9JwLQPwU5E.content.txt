Thank You Happy Birthday is the second studio album by American rock band Cage the Elephant. It was released on January 11, 2011 to positive critical reception. The album was produced by Jay Joyce, who worked in the same capacity on the band's eponymous debut album.


== Recording and production ==
The album was originally announced in July 2009 when the band had stated that they would release it in early 2010 with the title Computer Says Move. The group had recorded over eighty songs but shelved all of them when they realized that "nobody was really into" any of the ideas. The group then took ideas that they had saved for "side projects" and decided to use those songs for the album, which was then given the current title. The band once again worked with Jay Joyce, who had helped them record their first album. The band had trouble recording the songs, with lead singer Matt Shultz, in particular, having trouble finding the inspiration to write the lyrics for songs such as "Flow." The group was able to work out twelve songs for the album, stating: "We want each of our songs to sound like it's been written by a different band."

== Reception ==
The reception for the album has been generally positive. Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100, currently gives it a score of 76/100 based on twenty-two critics' reviews. Alternative Press stated that the record was "an alarmingly good album." Jon Pareles of The New York Times added that "the new album is more abrasive, rowdier, more unstable and pushier in the right ways," going on to say that when the album is "[p]layed quietly, like a Beatles ballad, it's brave enough to set bravado aside." Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone said of lead singer Matt Shultz: "Shultz coos, 'All I got is nothing but a little bit of love.' He's got another thing, actually: one of rock's best young bands."


== Legacy ==
Matt Shultz would later look back on the album five years after the release of "Shake Me Down", in an interview with Alternative Nation. He said, "There are definitely some times where I look back and wish I had let more of myself into the album. Earlier in my life, I had so much stock in the persona, and believed too much in 'the character' in the realm of pop and rock music, whatever pedal you want to put on it. The modern… whatever. It’s part of the story, and it is what it was."
