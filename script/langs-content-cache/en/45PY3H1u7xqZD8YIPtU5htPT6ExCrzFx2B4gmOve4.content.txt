"Music! Music! Music! (Put Another Nickel In)" is a popular song written by Stephen Weiss and Bernie Baum and published in 1950.


== Background ==
The first recording of the song was by Etienne Paree with Eddie "Piano" Miller, released by Rainbow Records in 1949 in the United States, titled "Put Another Nickel In - Music, Music, Music (The Nickelodeon Song)".
The biggest-selling version of the song was recorded by Teresa Brewer with the Dixieland All Stars on 20 December 1949, and released on December 26 by London Records as catalog number 604. New York morning radio host Gene Rayburn lobbied for Teresa Brewer to record it. He and Dee Finch played it regularly on WNEW, and it became a number 1 hit and a million-seller in 1950. It became Brewer's signature song and earned her the nickname "Miss Music". It was released as the B side to "Copenhagen" but eclipsed "Copenhagen" as a hit.
It was also recorded by many artists on various labels and other hit versions in 1950 were by Carmen Cavallaro (reached No. 5), Freddy Martin (No. 5), Ames Brothers (No. 14), Hugo Winterhalter (No. 17) and Mickey Katz (No. 18).Some radio stations refused to play the record because of the thought that the lyric "I'd do anything for you/Anything you'd want me to" might be construed as indecent.
