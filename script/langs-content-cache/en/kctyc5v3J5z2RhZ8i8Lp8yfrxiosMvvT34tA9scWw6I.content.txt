The 58th Annual TV Week Logie Awards were held on Sunday 8 May 2016 at the Crown Palladium in Melbourne, and broadcast live on the Nine Network. Public voting for the Best Award categories began on 16 November 2015, and ended on 17 January 2016. Nominations were announced on 3 April 2016, along with the winners of the Outstanding Newcomer Awards.
It was announced on 4 November 2015, that the 2016 Logie Awards would reinstate the Logie Award for Best Factual Program, as well as a new publicly voted category for Best News Panel or a Current Affairs Program. Two new industry-voted awards were also given, Logie Award for Most Outstanding Supporting Actor and Actress. Additionally, all publicly voted category awards changed their title from "Most Popular" to "Best" awards.

The 2016 ceremony will also be the first to accept nominations for original Australian content produced by or airing on streaming media such as Netflix, Presto and Stan. Comedy series No Activity, distributed by Stan, earned 3 nominations, thus becoming the first program premiering on a streaming service to earn a Logie nomination.

== Controversies during Logies night ==

The Seven Network's, Sydney-based, news and weather anchor Mark Ferguson and sports anchor Mel McLaughlin, the winners of the Logie for Most Outstanding News Coverage for the Parramatta Shooting, were not present to accept the award personally. 
TV Week had been informed a week earlier that Ferguson and McLaughlin had been prevented from attending the Logie Awards on the rival Nine Network because of their commitments to the Sydney-based 6pm local news bulletin, having to stay at Seven's Martin Place news studios that evening and throughout night, presenting news updates. Seven had offered to work around these logistics if they could be assured that Seven News had won a Logie award. In the interests of maintaining the security of the Logies results, TV Week could not release such information to the news department in advance, even in the strictest confidence. The Logie was instead accepted on stage by their boss Rob Rashke.
