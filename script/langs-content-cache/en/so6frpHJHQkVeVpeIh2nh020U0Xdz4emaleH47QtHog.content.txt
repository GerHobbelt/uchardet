The Flow is an album by Chris Leslie released in 1997.
This album is mostly instrumental. Although Chris Leslie is best known for his fiddle playing in Fairport Convention, these cuts sound nothing like Fairport or any of his other prior musical projects. The album demonstrates Leslie's breadth of musicality, influence and inspiration from across the globe.
