Gymnobathra ambigua is a species of moth in the family Oecophoridae. It is endemic to New Zealand. This species has been classified as critically endangered by the Department of Conservation.


== Taxonomy ==
This species was first described by Alfred Philpott in 1926 under the name Barea ambigua using male specimens collected by Mr. W. Heighway at Horseshoe Lake, Christchurch in November and December. In 1988, John S. Dugdale assigned Barea ambigua to the genus Gymnobathra. The taxonomy of this species continues to be debated, with some experts regarding Gymnobathra ambigua as being a synonym of G. thetodes and arguing that Dugdale wrongly synonymised G. thetodes under G. dinocosma. The holotype specimen is held at the Canterbury museum.
