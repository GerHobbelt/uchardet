---

The Painter and Limner is a member of the Royal Household in Scotland.  Appointments of Court Painters are recorded from 1581 onwards, and the post of Painter and Limner was created in 1702 for George Ogilvie. The duties included "drawing pictures of our [the Monarch's] person or of our successors or others of our royal family for the decorment of our houses and palaces". From 1723 to 1823 the office was a sinecure held by members of the Abercrombie family, not necessarily connected with artistic ability. The appointment of Sir Henry Raeburn in 1823, a few months before his death marked a return to conferring the post on a distinguished Scottish artist. He was succeeded by David Wilkie.
From 1841 until 1932, the salary attached to the office was £100. Since 1932 the appointment has been unpaid and there has been no requirement for the holder to produce works for either the monarch or the state. Until 1864 appointments were made by commission under the Privy Seal. Since 1908 appointments have been by warrant under the royal sign manual.
The post was held by Dame Elizabeth Blackadder from 2001 until her death in 2021.
