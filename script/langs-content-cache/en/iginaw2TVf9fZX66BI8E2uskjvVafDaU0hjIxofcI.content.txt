Among the artists involved include Bob Sinclar, Martin Solveig, David Guetta, Yves Larock, DJ Gregory (Grégory Darsa), Malinga Five, Joachim Garraud, Tim Deluxe, KC Flightt, Björn Lundt, Yvan Voice, Osibisa, Tom & Joyce, Tony Allen, NaSSau, Lekan Babalola, Jacob Desvarieux/Kassav, Shinichi Osawa, Salomé de Bahia, Liquid People, Eddie Amador, House Rules, Jeff Kellner, Légo and Those Usual Suspects.
In 2005, Tommy Boy Records bought the project to its label in the United States and released its first single from Africanism III set, "Summer Moon". This lead-off track went to number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart the week of 23 July 2005.  "Hard" became the act's second U.S. dance chart-topper in November 2006.
