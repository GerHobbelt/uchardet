== Career ==
As a junior, she competed on the road in the junior events at the 2014 UCI Road World Championships and 2015 UCI Road World Championships. 
She won the silver medal in the women's under-23 event at the 2016 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships in Heusden-Zolder and took the bronze in the under-23 race on home soil at the 2017 UEC European Cyclo-cross Championships in Tábor. In 2017 she also won both the Czech National Road Race Championships and the Czech National Time Trial Championships.At the 2018 European Road Cycling Championships in Brno, Czech Republic, Nosková won two medals on home soil, taking the bronze in the under-23 time trial before winning the under-23 road race title. Nosková broke away from the peloton in a three rider group alongside under-23 time trial winner Aafke Soet and Elena Pirrone; they built up a lead of three-and-a-half minutes over the bunch before Nosková launched a solo attack with about 65 kilometres (40 miles) to go, crossing the finish line with a nearly four-minute lead over Soet in second. In August 2018, the then-named Cervélo–Bigla Pro Cycling announced that she would join them for the 2019 season. She remained with the team until it folded during the 2020 season.
In September 2020, Nosková signed a contract with the  SD Worx team.
