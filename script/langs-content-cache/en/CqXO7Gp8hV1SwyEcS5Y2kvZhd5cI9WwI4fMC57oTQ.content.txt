Type-Moon (stylized as TYPE-MOON) is a Japanese video game company, best known for their visual novels, co-founded by author Kinoko Nasu and illustrator Takashi Takeuchi. It is also known under the name Notes Co., Ltd. (有限会社ノーツ, Yūgen gaisha Nōtsu) for its publishing and corporate operations, as it is the company official name, while Type-Moon is a brand name as a homage to the original doujin group. After creating the popular visual novel Tsukihime as a doujin soft circle, Type-Moon has since incorporated and produced the even more popular visual novel Fate/stay night, which became its most well-known title. The latter has also been adapted into anime and manga series that have amassed a global fanbase.


== History ==
Type-Moon was founded by artist Takashi Takeuchi and writer Kinoko Nasu, whose first project was the novel Kara no Kyoukai, which was originally released in October 1998 and reprinted in 2004. The company name Type-Moon comes from one of Nasu's older works, Notes. [sic], written for the angel-themed doujin anthology Angel Voice in May 1999. On December 28, 2000, Type-Moon released the adult Windows visual novel Tsukihime, which sold extremely well and amassed a large fanbase because of its comprehensive and expansive storyline and writer Kinoko Nasu's unique style of storytelling. The game led to the creation of numerous top-selling merchandise, memorabilia, and a fanbase numbering millions worldwide. Tsukihime was adapted soon after in 2003 into an anime series, Lunar Legend Tsukihime, which was produced by J.C.Staff and licensed by Geneon in North America, and a manga series based upon Lunar Legend Tsukihime that has been published between October 2003 and September 2010.
Soon after, on January 21, 2001, Type-Moon released a bonus disk to Tsukihime, Plus-Disk, which featured four short stories and various multimedia. In August 2001, Type-Moon released a fan disk to Tsukihime, Kagetsu Tohya, and soon, in April 2003, released Tsuki-Bako, a specially packaged three-disk set that included Tsukihime, Plus-Disk, and Kagetsu Tohya, as well as a remixed soundtrack for both games and more multimedia.
On December 30, 2002, Type-Moon, in association with French-Bread (known as Watanabe Seisakujo before 2003), released their first fighting game, Melty Blood, a PC-based doujin game based on the Tsukihime universe, which was very popular and was followed soon after by an expansion, Melty Blood Re-ACT, released on May 20, 2004, to which a patch update, Melty Blood Re-ACT Final Tuned, was released as a free download over the Internet. Melty Blood is widely considered among the best doujin 2D fighting games ever made and has been released as an arcade port, Melty Blood: Act Cadenza, on March 25, 2005, and was released on the PS2 platform on August 10, 2006.
Type-Moon soon transitioned from a doujin soft organization to a commercial organization. On 30 January 2004, they released the first commercial release, a PC-based adult visual novel game, Fate/stay night, which broke all records on its opening day and became immensely popular. It was later adapted into an anime series that aired 24 episodes in Japan starting 6 January 2006; a second anime series that premiered on October 4, 2014; and a manga series that ran in publication between 26 December 2005 and 26 October 2012, in Monthly Shounen Ace. A sequel to Fate/stay night, Fate/hollow ataraxia, was released on 28 October 2005. Fate/stay night was also released on the PS2 platform on April 19, 2007. A prequel, Fate/Zero, was released as a light novel written by Gen Urobuchi (from nitro+) under Kinoko Nasu's supervision, featuring art by Takashi Takeuchi, in 2006–2007, followed by an animated adaptation by ufotable in 2011–2012.
At Comiket 72 on August 27, 2007, they released the "All Around TYPE-MOON drama CD".
In August 2019, Type-Moon announced that they established a new company called Type-Moon Studio BB, a video game development studio with former Square Enix and Atlus employee Kazuya Nino, who was a director for the series Trauma Center, Etrian Odyssey and Dragon Quest Builders as the head of the studio. According to Nino, the company plans to develop medium to large-scale 3D games in cooperation with external developers and small-scale 2D games developed in-house.
