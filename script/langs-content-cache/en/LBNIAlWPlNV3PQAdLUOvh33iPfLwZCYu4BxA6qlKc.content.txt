Ip Chun (born Ip Hok-chun; 10 July 1924), also known as Yip Chun or Yip Jun, is a Chinese martial artist and actor in the style of Wing Chun. He is the elder of two sons. Chun's father Ip Man was the Wing Chun teacher of Bruce Lee.


== Early life ==
He was born Ip Hok-chun in Foshan, Guangdong on 10 July 1924 to police officer and martial artist Ip Man and his wife Cheung Wing-sing.
In 1949, after the Communists established the People's Republic of China on the Chinese mainland, Ip's father left for Hong Kong and Ip, then 24, remained in Foshan to continue his studies in university. However, in 1962, due to the Cultural Revolution, Ip and his younger brother, Ip Ching, were forced to leave Foshan and move to Hong Kong to join their father.


== Education ==
Ip studied Chinese history, philosophy, poetry, traditional music, and Buddhism. In 1950, Ip had completed his studies and he chose teaching as a profession. In addition to teaching Chinese history, music and science, Ip also helped the Chinese Foshan Entertainment Department organise opera plays. During that time, he was awarded "The Person with the Most Potential in Chinese Art" award for his research in music.


== Professional career ==
In Hong Kong, Ip worked as an accountant and newspaper reporter in the day and practiced Wing Chun in the evening under his father's tutelage. In accordance with his father's wishes, in 1965, Ip participated in the affairs of the Ving Tsun Athletic Association and became one of its founding members when it was formally established in 1968. During the first three years in the association, Ip took on the role of treasurer and was later appointed as chairman.


== Teaching accomplishments ==
In 1967, Ip began teaching Wing Chun in Hong Kong and some of his first students, such as Leung Chung-wai and Ho Kay, chairman of Wing Chun Ip Chun Academy and a student of Ip for three decades, still train with him at present. Ip's father died in December 1972 and entrusted the film footage of his Siu Nim Tao, Chum Kiu and Muk Yan Jong forms to his sons for posterity. In 2014 Ip Chun was selected as a nominee to represent Wing Chun as the inheritor of the legacy of Wing Chun-style kung fu. Ip Chun has taught and held seminars in many cities, including countries such as Australia, England and the United States.


== In film ==
Ip Chun had a small role in the 1976 film Bruce Lee: The Man, The Myth as Bruce Lee's Wing Chun Sifu (Ip Man). Ip made a special appearance as Ip Man in the 1999 film What You Gonna Do, Sai Fung? (a.k.a. 1959 某日某).  Ip served as a consultant for Ip Man, a 2008 Hong Kong film about the life of his father. He also made another special appearance as Leung Bik (son of Leung Jan) in another film, The Legend is Born – Ip Man. In 2013, he made a cameo appearance in another Ip Man film, Ip Man: The Final Fight.
