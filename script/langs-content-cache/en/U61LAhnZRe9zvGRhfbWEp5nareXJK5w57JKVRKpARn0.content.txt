Bunker Hill, (also known as Carley), is an unincorporated community in Marion County located 9.3 miles (15.0 km) miles north-northeast of Columbia on Mississippi Highway 35.


== History ==
Bunker Hill was originally known as Carley and once had a masonic lodge, school, and two stores. The community eventually became known as Bunker Hill. There are two theories as to where the name Bunker Hill originated: one theory says it is named for the large hill on which the community is located. Another story tells that after the community was chosen as the site to open a new school in Marion County, the citizens felt they had worked as hard "as the men did to win the Battle of Bunker Hill".In 1900, Bunker Hill had a population of 32.A post office operated under the name Carley from 1880 to 1907.
