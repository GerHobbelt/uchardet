In 2015, artist Peter Jansen and PolyVision were commissioned to create the "Flat Earth" mural for the Dijkzigt Metro Station. "Flat Earth" consists of 1,250 digital prints of photographs taken by Jansen during the 20 years he spent traveling around the world. The images are arranged in a panorama-like manner. The mural was unveiled in April 2016.
