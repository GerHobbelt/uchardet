== Synopsis ==


=== Act One ===
William Shakespeare is introduced by the cast at his first production of Romeo and Juliet, who then welcomes the audience to his newest play ("Larger than Life"). Shakespeare then also introduces his wife, Anne Hathaway, who is visiting from Stratford-upon-Avon to see the play. She suggests he change the ending, wondering what would have happened if Juliet did not kill herself, much to Shakespeare' displeasure ("I Want It That Way"). Nevertheless, Shakespeare allows his wife to explain her idea for the play, which begins with Juliet waking up to find Romeo dead ("...Baby One More Time").
At Romeo's funeral, Juliet finds out that Romeo had many other relationships, with both men and women ("Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely") and, upon learning of their forbidden relationship, Juliet's parents decide they will send her to a convent. May, Juliet's non-binary friend, and Angelique, her nurse, come to her rescue, while Anne writes herself into the play as 'April', another of Juliet's friends. The four of them decide to take a road trip to Paris ("Domino"). Anne writes Shakespeare into her story as a carriage driver, as the trip to Paris begins ("Show Me Love").
Once in France, they attend a ball which is intended as a party for Francois. His father, Lance, tells him he must either marry or join the army, even though Francois does not wish to pursue either option. Meanwhile, Juliet, Angelique, May, and April sneak into the party ("Blow"). Francois notices their arrival, but does not mind that they crashed his party. May reveals to Juliet that they suffer from gendered concepts such as gender-specific bathrooms and gendered languages, like the French language ("I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman"). Francois and Juliet begin to bond about their stifled lives and shared experiences ("Overprotected"). Francois finds himself attracted to Juliet, and they dance together ("Confident").
Angelique and Lance spend the night together, and it is revealed that she was formerly the nurse to his children. Lance asks her to stay, while Angelique wants to continue to look after Juliet ("Teenage Dream/Break Free"). Juliet wakes up next to Francois, who proposes, causing Juliet to agonise about her previous relationship with Romeo ("Oops!... I Did It Again"). When her parents arrive to take her to the convent, she quickly accepts Francois' proposal, before discovering Angelique and Lance's previous relationship. Anne challenges Shakespeare for making Juliet get married again, and complains that he never writes about happy marriages.
Deciding that he needs to introduce a conflict or a plot twist to Anne's version of the play, Shakespeare has Francois and May meet again. After the two share a sudden kiss, they both feel conflicted ("I Kissed a Girl"). Making things even more complicated, Shakespeare intends to bring Romeo back from the dead, despite Anne's protests. Romeo arrives and declares his return, saying that he has come back for his wife ("It's My Life").


=== Act Two ===
Romeo finds Juliet, forgives her for not killing herself, and wants to go back to being married to her ("Love Me Like You Do"). Juliet reveals to Romeo her engagement with Francois ("Since You've Been Gone"). Shakespeare is frustrated with Anne that Juliet did not listen to Romeo's side of events. Anne counters that this is important to her and that she feels Shakespeare cares more about his plays than his family. Angered, Anne breaks Shakespeare's quill, meaning that neither of them can make any further changes to the story.
May grows angry at Francois for ignoring his feelings for them and for still planning on marrying Juliet ("Whataya Want From Me"), while Juliet complains to May that Romeo lied to her. Francois grows worried, as he hasn't told Juliet about his feelings for May.
Romeo and Juliet meet up again, where Romeo reflects that he only ever felt valued for his looks and that Juliet made him want to be a better person ("One More Try"). Despite their recent bonding, Juliet remains unsure of her feelings towards Romeo ("Problem/Can't Feel My Face"). Francois' brother (in fact Shakespeare in disguise) invites Romeo to join the family band, who will play at Juliet and Francois' wedding. Angelique, in the meantime, proposes to Lance.
Anne discovers that Juliet is still in love with Romeo and recounts her own romance with Shakespeare ("That's the Way It Is"). At the wedding, Shakespeare, May, Francois, Lance and Romeo perform ("Everybody"). Francois begins to read his vows to Juliet ("As Long as You Love Me"). However, both Juliet and Francois change their minds about getting married, with Francois confessing his feelings for May ("It's Gonna Be Me"). This prompts Romeo to again confess his love to Juliet while her parents insist she returns to Verona with them, stating that they know what's best for her, which Juliet refutes ("Stronger").
Lance apologizes to Francois and accepts his and May's relationship ("Shape of My Heart"). Angelique reassures Juliet that she will never leave her ("Fuckin' Perfect"), but Juliet insists Angelique goes with Lance, before deciding to be confident and take charge of her own destiny ("Roar").
Shakespeare complains that Anne ruined his play, and that he only brought back Romeo to give Juliet the happy ending he thought Anne wanted. Anne refutes this, saying she wants Juliet to be able to make her own choices. Realizing he has hurt Anne, Shakespeare apologizes ("I Want It That Way – Reprise").
Shakespeare and Anne agree there does not need to be a conclusive ending, rather a new beginning. Romeo apologizes to Juliet and they decide to go on a first date, Angelique and Lance get married, and Francois and May begin a relationship.
Because he wants everyone to go home happy, Shakespeare and the company perform ("Can't Stop the Feeling!").
