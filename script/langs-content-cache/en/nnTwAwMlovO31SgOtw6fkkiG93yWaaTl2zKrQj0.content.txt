Beggar on a Beach of Gold is the fourth album by Mike + the Mechanics, released on 6 March 1995. This album contains three singles: the No. 12 hit "Over My Shoulder", the No. 33 hit "A Beggar on a Beach of Gold", and the No. 51 hit "Another Cup of Coffee". All three songs charted in Germany as well, and "Another Cup of Coffee" was also popular in Russia; "Over My Shoulder" was particularly successful in France, reaching No.9. The album was certified Gold by the BPI for sales of 100,000 copies. Adrian Lee performed on this album as a session musician following his departure from the band, and this was drummer Peter Van Hooke's last album as an official member of the band as he left the band shortly after the album's release.
