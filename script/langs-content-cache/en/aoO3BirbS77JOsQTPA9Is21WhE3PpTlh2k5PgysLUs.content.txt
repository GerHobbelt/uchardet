"Niemand sonst" ("No one else") is a song by the German singer Yvonne Catterfeld, recorded for her first album Meine Welt (2003). It was written by Götz von Sydow and Ralf Hildenbeutel and produced by the latter with Matthias Hoffmann and Steffen Britzke under their production name Schallbau. A mid-tempo pop soul track with slight elements of the contemporary R&B genre, it was the second single to precede Meine Welt and reached number 31 on the German Singles Chart.
